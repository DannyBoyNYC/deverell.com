## development notes

'Warning: [sanity] Using `watchMode` when not in develop mode might prevent your build from completing'

'warning The type `SanityImageAsset` does not explicitly define the field `childImageSharp`.
On types with the `@dontInfer` directive, or with the `infer` extension set to `false`, automatically adding fields for children types is deprecated.
In Gatsby v3, only children fields explicitly set with the `childOf` extension will be added.'
