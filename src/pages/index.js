              My website is currently being re-developed to permit some overdue

            As I reorganize my Blog, this seems an opportune time to revise and
            post a short short story published a while ago by Maclean's Magazine
            in a tongue-in-cheek series titled <em>Trumpâ€™s Last Chapter</em>.
            Several Canadian authors were asked to envision Donald Trump's
            downfall.

            Arthur Beauchamp takes on the most explosive trial of his career:
            the defence of seven boisterous environmentalists accused of
            sabotaging a plant in Ontario that pumps out a pesticide that has
            led to the mass deaths of honeybees. The story zigzags between
            Toronto, where the trial takes place, and Arthur's West Coast island
            home where he finds himself arrested for fighting his own
            environmental cause: the threatened destruction of a popular park.
            The Toronto trial concludes with a tense, hang-by-the-fingernails
            jury verdict. The story is told from points of view of Arthur and a
            vibrant young woman activist and a tough, cynical OPP Inspector.
            Throughout, Arthur struggles to save his marriage.
